The BLOG Project is a full stack web app that uses React and React-Router-DOM on the frontend to create components and pages as a single-page-application,
and Express, Mongoose and Bcrypt to create Routers and Middleware with user authentication on the backend.

The UI design resembles a cross between Tumblr and MySpace. Pages on the frontend include: Home, Login, Register, Write, Settings, Post.
